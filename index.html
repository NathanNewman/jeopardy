    <p>
      Jeopardy is a quiz competion. Competitor's are asked to select clue's
      orangized by categories. Each clue has a $ value. The competitor's are
      asked to answer each clue starting with the phrase "what is..." In this
      version of Jeopardy you will be given a game board with categories and $
      values. Click the $ values to reveal the clue. State your answer, then
      click the clue to reveal the answer to see if you answered correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      If playing with friends, have each friend give an answer with the first
      friend to answer being given the highest priority. Then click the clue to
      reveal the answer. The first correct answer wins the point total of the
      clue. (you'll have to keep track of scores yourself) The winner of each
      clue selects the next clue to reveal. The one with the most points in the
      end is the game winner.
